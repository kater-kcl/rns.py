Random Name Selector  
Just read the code by yourself.I am tired of writing documents.
it's a "simple" random name selector,but you can use it do some interesting things.
1.it is ran on python3.
2.please creat a files named "namelist.txt" in the same path,then write the name in it.
3.you can make yourself a cheater! you can not be randed if you write your name on line 34! don't forget turn on the cheat mode(in line 32)
4.it may creat a "RNSlog.txt" in the same path. if you don't want see it,you can turn off it at line 36.
